Explain what break does. Be sure to explain both of its forms.

Break is used to break out of loops and switch statements. It ends the current looping when used in a loop. A break in switch will prevent other cases in the switch from being executed.

Break can also be used to move to a labeled statement. The break statement terminates the labeled statement; it does not transfer the flow of control to the label. Control flow is transferred to the statement immediately following the labeled (terminated) statement.
