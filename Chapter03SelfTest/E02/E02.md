Show the general form of the if-else-if ladder.
```java
if (condition1) {
    ... // Block that will be executed if condition1 is true.
} else if(condition2) {
    ... // Block that will be executed if condition2 is true.
} else {
    ... // Block that will be executed of none of the conditions are true.
}
```
The ladder has only two if statements. It is possible to have more if statements in the ladder if needed.
