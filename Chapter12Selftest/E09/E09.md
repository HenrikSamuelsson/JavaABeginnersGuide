 Is static import designed for special-case situations, or is it good practice to bring all static members of all classes into view?

Static import is for special case situations, when frequent access to static members from one or two classes is required. Overuse of the static import feature, can make a program unreadable and unmaintainable, polluting its namespace with all the imported static members.
