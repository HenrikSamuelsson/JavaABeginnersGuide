Why does Java define both byte and character streams?

Byte streams can handle any binary byte by byte. How the data in the stream shall be interpreted must be handled by the program.

Character streams are a form of byte stream for handling of Unicode characters. Each characters is coded as two bytes in Unicode. There is built in functionality in the character stream to parse those two bytes to a character.
