1.  How does Javaâ€™s multithreading capability enable you to write more efficient programs?

Multithreading makes it easy to keep  the user interface of a program responsive while the program does something else at the same time (downloading a file for example).

Multithreading makes it possible to run low priority tasks when the system is idle and give full priority to more important tasks when they need to run.

Multithreading supports modern multi core CPU's in natural way.
