Can the wildcard argument be bounded?

Yes, arguments can be set to have  an upper bound like this `<? extends T>` or a lower bound like this `<? super T>`. Upper bound hence means that the wildcard is restricted to types that extends T and lower bounds means that wildcard is restricted to types that are ancestors of T.
