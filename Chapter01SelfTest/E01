What is bytecode and why is it important to JavaÂ´s use for Internet programming?

Bytecode is a translation of the Java source code to a instruction set that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine. 
Byte code allow for better performance than direct interpretation of source code.

Byte code reduces hardware and operating system dependance by allowing the same code to run on different platforms.
A Java Virtual Machine incorporated into an Internet application, such as a web browser, makes it possible to run Java
programs on a wide variety of different types of computer architectures connected to the Internet.
