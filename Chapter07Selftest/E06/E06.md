 A superclass reference can refer to a subclass object. Explain why this is important as it relates to method overriding.

Method overriding forms the basis for one of Javaâ€™s most powerful concepts: dynamic method dispatch. Dynamic method dispatch is the mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at run time rather than compile time. Dynamic method dispatch is important because this is how Java implements run-time polymorphism.
