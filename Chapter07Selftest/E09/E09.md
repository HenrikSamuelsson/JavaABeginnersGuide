 Explain how inheritance, method overriding, and abstract classes are used to support polymorphism.

The methods in the abstract class forms an interface. This interface defines what subclasses of the abstract shall be able to handle. All subclasses of the abstract class supports the same interface by eventual necessary adaptations to the implementations of the overriding methods.
