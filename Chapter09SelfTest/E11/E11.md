What are the three ways that an exception can be generated?

Generated exceptions can be divided into three subgroups.

The first group is formed by exceptions that are beyond the control of the software developers. These can be generated by errors in the JVM or errors from physical failure of the hardware that the system runs on like for example damaged memory cells.

The second group are exceptions caused by the Java code. These can be because of  programming bugs or users that enter illegal input.

The third way is that exceptions can be thrown explicitly in the code.
