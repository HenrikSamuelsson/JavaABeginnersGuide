What is wrong with this fragment?
```java
class A extends Exception { // Rest of class omitted.

class B extends A { // Rest of class omitted.

// Omitted program code..

try {
	// Code in try block here.
}
catch (A exc) { 
	// Catch block code here.
}
catch (B exc) { 
	// Catch block code here. 
}
```
The problem with the above code is that the first catch block should be placed below the second block.

A is a superclass of B. This means that A will catch its own exceptions and all subclass exceptions that B could possibly handle. Unreachable code is created and this will cause a compiler error.
