 Briefly explain how to use try and catch.

Try and catch are used together to handle exceptions in Java. A try block is followed by one or more catch blocks like in the following code snippet.
```java
try {
	// Code that make up the try block goes here.
} catch (ExceptionTypeA name) {
	// Code that make up a catch block goes here.
} catch (ExceptionTypeB name) {
	// There could possibly be many catch block for different types of exceptions.
}
```
The code in the try block can cause an exception, this is called throwing an exception. The following catch block code will be run when the exception throwed matches the exception type in the catch statement. Any action needed to handle the exception shall be taken inside the catch block.

It is in this way possible to separate error handling code from error the ordinary code flow. This makes the code easier to follow.
