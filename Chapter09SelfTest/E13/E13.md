What is the multi-catch feature?

The multi-catch feature allows one catch clause to catch two or more exception by the use of a vertical bar ( | ) to OR together exceptions . This feature can be used in Java SE 7 and later and can reduce code duplication and lessen the temptation to catch an overly broad exception.
