What is the difference between a class and an object?

A class is a general concept (like an Animal), an object is a very specific embodiment of that class, with a limited lifespan (like a lion, cat, or a zebra). Classes are static templates that are designed during the implementation phase. Objects will then belong to a class and are dynamically created and destroyed when the program runs.
