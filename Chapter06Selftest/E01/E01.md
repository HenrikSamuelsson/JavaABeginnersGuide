Given this fragment,
```java
class X {
	private int count;
```
is the following fragment correct?
```java
class Y { 
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		X ob = new X();

		ob.count;
```
No the fragment is not is not correct. The member X is declared private so it can not be accessed outside of its class.
