Show an example of an overloaded varargs method that is ambiguous.

Here is one example of an overloaded varargs method that is ambiguous.
```java
double exampleMethod(double ... v) { // Rest of method omitted.
double exampleMethod(double ... v) { // Rest of method omitted.
```
Calling exampleMethod( ) with one argument, like this, 
```java
exampleMethod(1.1);
```
means that the compiler canâ€™t determine which version of the method to invoke.
