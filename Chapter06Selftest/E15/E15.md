Show an example of an overloaded varargs method that is ambiguous.

Here is one example of an overloaded varargs method that is ambiguous.
```java
double exampleMethod(double … v) { // Rest of method omitted.
double exampleMethod(double … v) { // Rest of method omitted.
```
Calling exampleMeth( ) with one argument, like this, 
```java
exampleMeth(1.1);
```
means that the compiler can’t determine which version of the method to invoke.
