Can the for loops that perform sorting in the Bubble class shown in Try This 5-1 be converted into for-each style loops? If not, why not?

No not without extra bookkeeping that would make the code complicated and clumsy. One problem is that there would be no counter in the inner loop to keep track of when to stop sorting in the inner loop. Another problem would be the fact that values used in for-each loops can only be read and there is no way to do assignment to the underlying array.
