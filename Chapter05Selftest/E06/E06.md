Since all strings are objects of type String, show how you can call the length( ) and charAt( ) methods on this string literal: "I like Java".

The length and charAt methods can be applied directly to the string literals. See the below code fragment for an example.
```java
char c = "I like Java".charAt(7); // c will be set to J.
int l = "I like Java".length(); // l will be set to 11.
```
