Explain the difference between the prefix and postfix forms of the increment operator.

Suppose we have a variable called var. Both the prefix (++var) and postfix (var++) will increase the variable value by 1. The difference comes when the operators are used in a bigger context i.e. some kind of statment. The prefix version will first increase the variable and use the increased verison in the statement. The postfix version will use the unincremented variable value when evaluating the statment and will afterwards increase the variable value.
