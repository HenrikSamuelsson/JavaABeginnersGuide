What is wrong with this fragment?
```java
for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	int sum;

	sum = sum + i;
}
System.out.println("Sum is: " + sum);
```
The problem with the code is that the variable sum is declared inside the for loop. This means that it will be created on each iteration of the loop and the value will not be remembered as it probably should be. The second problem is that the variable is out of scope when used in the print statement meaning that the program will not even compile. The code should be like this instead. Note that sum is explicitly set to 0 since it is generally considered as bad programming style to rely on the default values.
```java
int sum = 0;
for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	sum = sum + i;
}
System.out.println("Sum is: " + sum);
```
