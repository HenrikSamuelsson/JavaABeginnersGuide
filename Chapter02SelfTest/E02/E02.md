  What is Javaâ€™s character type, and how does it differ from the character type used by some other programming languages?

The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum value of hex 0000 (or 0) and a maximum value of hex ffff (or 65,535 inclusive). The char type is in other programming languages based on a 8-bit value and the ASCII table.
