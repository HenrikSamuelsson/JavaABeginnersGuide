What is a namespace?

A namespace in computer science, is an abstract container or environment created to hold a logical grouping of unique identifiers or symbols (i.e., names). Namespaces makes it possible to choose names for for the components (i.e. classes, variables methods and so on)  without risking confusion should another developer happen to choose the same name.

Why is it important that Java allows you to partition the namespace?

It is the partition that isolates parts of a program into separate packages in Java. The name of the packages then makes it possible for the compiler to resolve which identifier that is intended without risk for collisions.
