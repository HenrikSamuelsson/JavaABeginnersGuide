  Assume that the ICharQ interface shown in Try This 8-1 has been in widespread use for several years. Now, you want to add a method to it called reset( ), which will be used to reset the queue to its empty, starting condition. Assuming JDK 8 or later, how can this be accomplished without breaking preexisting code?

Add a default reset() method to the new version of the interface. This means that old existing code will not be broken if it uses the new version of the interface.

Note that the default reset() method is usually not intended to do any work. It is just there to prevent old code from malfunctioning if the old code starts using the new updated interface. It is common to have  the default method throw an exception as an indication that it is not intended to be used.
