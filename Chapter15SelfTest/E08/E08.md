 Briefly describe the assert keyword.

The assert keyword is used enables testing of assumptions for a program. For example, a method that calculates the speed of a particle, can be asserted that the calculated speed should be less than the speed of light.

Each assertion contains a boolean expression that should be true when the assertion executes. If it is not true, the system will throw an error.
