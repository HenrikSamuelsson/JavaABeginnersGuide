Briefly explain Javaâ€™s delegation event model.

The event model is based on the concept of an Event Source and Event Listeners. The event source will send out messages, event Listeners will receive these messages and act upon them  and then return. 

The word delegation comes from that the user interface is able to delegate the processing of an event to a separate piece of code.
