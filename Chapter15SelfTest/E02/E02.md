 Explain why an applet must use multithreading if it needs to run continually.

Applets are event driven. An event will occur and some code will be run rather quickly, the applet is then ready to handle the next event. Code that does not run for just a short time on the main thread will block events from firing, the applet will then become unresponsive from the users perspective. Things that take long time to execute shall hence be run on separate thread.
